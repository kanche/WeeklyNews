## WeeklyNews Digest: A Parse + React [Demo](http://kanche.github.io/WeeklyNews)

This demo is a weekly news digest reader I hacked together to learn about Parse. It has user sign-up/log in module inspired from parse example. The app shows short twitter like news for a given week in a two column mailbox fashion. 

##Parse Classes

```
Week: {
        "name": "January 1, 2015",
        "weekno": 1
    }
```
```
News: {
        
        "title": "Furry Becomes President",
        "description": "Furry Purrmatma has been selected as the president of World Cat Congress.",
        "weekno": 1
    }
```

## To Run:

```
npm install   
npm start  
```

Now open the `index.html` file.
